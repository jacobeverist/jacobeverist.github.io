# Overview

I got my PhD in 2015 from the University of Southern California.  I've been working with space systems in industry since then.  In my spare time I've been conducting my own research on extracting principles from the brain and putting them into algorithmic form for high-performance applications.

For those looking to hire me, I have a deep area of expertise in AI, machine learning, data science, and robotics. I have a research-oriented entrepreneurial approach to identifying and solving customer problems. I can communicate complex concepts in easy-to-understand terms and can channel engineer talent and energy into recognizable customer value.

# Projects

## Active

### Discrete Cortical Circuits Dashboard

[DCC Dashboard](https://github.com/jacobeverist/dcc-public/tree/main/embedded_dcc_viewer_v1) is a real-time interactive dashboard for visualizing and experimenting with Discrete Cortical Circuits computational networks. Built with React, ReactFlow, and WebAssembly (WASM) for high-performance neural computation.




## Dormant

### BrainBlocks

[BrainBlocks](https://github.com/jacobeverist/brainblocks) is a framework originall co-developed by me at The Aerospace Corporation for building scalable Machine Learning (ML) applications using principles derived from computational neuroscience. It models neuron activations with binary patterns (vectors of 1s and 0s) which form a kind of "cortical language". Assemblages of computational blocks transmit these binary patterns between each other to create computational workflows that exploit these neuroscience principles.

### Opaque/DarkMapper

[Robotic Navigation and Mapping in Confined Environments Using Proprioception](https://github.com/jacobeverist/opaque)

This repository contains the experimental code and simulation framework developed for my PhD dissertation research. The project investigates how snake-like robotic probes can explore, map, and navigate through unknown confined environments when all external sensors have failed, relying solely on proprioception (joint angles and body contact) and physical interaction with the environment.
