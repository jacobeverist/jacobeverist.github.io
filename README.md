# Past Projects

## BrainBlocks

[BrainBlocks](https://github.com/jacobeverist/brainblocks) is a framework originall co-developed by me at The Aerospace Corporation for building scalable Machine Learning (ML) applications using principles derived from computational neuroscience. It models neuron activations with binary patterns (vectors of 1s and 0s) which form a kind of "cortical language". Assemblages of computational blocks transmit these binary patterns between each other to create computational workflows that exploit these neuroscience principles.

## Opaque/DarkMapper

[Robotic Navigation and Mapping in Confined Environments Using Proprioception](https://github.com/jacobeverist/opaque)

This repository contains the experimental code and simulation framework developed for my PhD dissertation research. The project investigates how snake-like robotic probes can explore, map, and navigate through unknown confined environments when all external sensors have failed, relying solely on proprioception (joint angles and body contact) and physical interaction with the environment.
