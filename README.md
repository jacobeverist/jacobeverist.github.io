# Overview

I received my computer science PhD in 2015 from the University of Southern California with the focus on robotic mapping in sensor-challenged environments.

Since then, I've been working at The Aerospace Corporation applying my skills to space systems with the goal to improve the scale and speed of mission assurance activities. 

In my spare time I've been conducting my own research on extracting computational principles from the brain and putting them into algorithmic form for high-performance applications.  This involves developing an entirely new paradigm for computation and representation that is fundamentally different from traditional neural network models that have seen so much popularity and success.

# My Projects

## Active

### [Discrete Cortical Circuits Dashboard](https://github.com/jacobeverist/dcc-public/tree/main/embedded_dcc_viewer_v1)

DCC Dashboard is a real-time interactive dashboard for visualizing and experimenting with Discrete Cortical Circuits computational networks. Built with React, ReactFlow, and WebAssembly (WASM) for high-performance neural computation.

## Dormant

### [BrainBlocks](https://github.com/jacobeverist/brainblocks)

BrainBlocks is a framework originally co-developed by myself and a partner at The Aerospace Corporation for building scalable Machine Learning (ML) applications using principles derived from computational neuroscience. It models neuron activations with binary patterns (vectors of 1s and 0s) which form a kind of "cortical language". Assemblages of computational blocks transmit these binary patterns between each other to create computational workflows that exploit these neuroscience principles.

### [Opaque / DarkMapper](https://github.com/jacobeverist/opaque)

This is a code repository containing the experimental code and simulation framework developed for my PhD dissertation research entitled, _Robotic Navigation and Mapping in Confined Environments Using Proprioception_. The project investigates how snake-like robotic probes can explore, map, and navigate through unknown confined environments when all external sensors have failed, relying solely on proprioception (joint angles and body contact) and physical interaction with the environment.
